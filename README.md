### Diabetes Prediction using Classification Techniques. 
Diabetes is a common, chronic disease. And it can lead to chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues. Therefore, the earlier diagnosis is obtained the much easier diabates is controlled. Our aim is to develop machine learning models using classification techniques to predict diabetes based on several features, namely; Glucose, Age, BMI, Insulin and the history of diabetes in the patient history.

### Our Achieved Result
A big part of machine learning is classification — we want to know what class (a.k.a. group) an observation belongs to. 
Data science provides a plenty of classification algorithms and we have used different ML techniques such as  logistic regression, support vector machine, Random Forest classifier, and decision trees. The performances of all algorithms are evaluated based on recall because we wanted to decrease the number of FN due to the high impact on diabetes patients. Results obtained show <strong> Ada boost classifier outperforms with the highest recall of 84% comparing to other algorithms </strong>.
