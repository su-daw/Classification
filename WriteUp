Diabetes Prediction using Classification Techniques
  

Abstract 
Diabetes is a serious chronic condition that poses a great threat to human health. Diabetes is characterized by a high blood glucose level caused by defective insulin secretion or impaired biological effects, or both. Diabetes can result in chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. Therefore, the ability to diagnose and analyze diabetes rapidly and accurately is a topic worth exploring. The earlier we can detect and manage it, the better. Using their physical examination data, machine learning can help people to make a preliminary diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and it can also be a helpful reference for doctors. The aim of this study is to predict diabetes accurately using a variety of machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), logistic regression, AdaBoost, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Classifiers. 

Data
The dataset is Pima Indians diabetics data. Specifically, all patients are Pima Indian women with a minimum age of 21. This dataset contains 8 features, with 768 observations. The features include pregnancy times, plasma glucose concentration following oral glucose tolerance tests, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, 2-hour serum insulin, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age. 

Algorithms
•	Pre-processing 
1- Cleaned the data and impute missing data with mean, checked for duplicate.
2- Created plots to visualize the relationships between the target and predictors, and between the variables themselves.
3- Split data into train and test.
4- Scaling data

•	Model Building
Several models were developed using different Machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Ada Boost and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The best algorithm was chosen based on the recall because we want to decrease the number of false negatives.

•	Model Selection and Evaluation 
The evaluation of our models was based on the Recall. 


Tools
•	Jupyter Notebook will be used to create and document live code and visualization
•	Pandas for data manipulation
•	Sklearn for model building 
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
